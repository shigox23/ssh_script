# ssh_script
Script to make it easier to generate ssh keys

It prompts user for email & passcode & keyfile name inputs to generate ssh-key.
Once ssh-key is generated it adds the private key to ssh-agent.

The script also allows one to upload their public key to a remote server.

Feel free to add the file to /usr/bin and run ssh-gen as a local command.
